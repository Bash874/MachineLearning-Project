# MachineLearning-Project
The projects discussed in this chat encompass a range of data analysis and machine learning techniques applied to real estate data. The first project delves into analyzing and visualizing real estate data to predict house prices per square meter using linear regression. Next, K-means clustering is employed to segment the real estate data into clusters, revealing trends and patterns in property attributes. A custom linear regression calculation function is developed to efficiently compute regression coefficients and formulate regression equations. Scatter plots are then utilized for data visualization, aiding in the exploration of relationships between various property features and house prices. Lastly, data analysis and model evaluation techniques, including the calculation of R-squared values, are employed to assess the performance of the linear regression model in predicting house prices accurately.uared.
Key Insights: Assessed model accuracy and suitability for predicting house prices.
